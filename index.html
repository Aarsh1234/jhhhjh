         <p>What is Visual Studio Code?</p>
         <p>
         Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
         </p>
         <p>Elements of Visual Studio Code:</p>
         <p>Console.log:</p>
         <p>The console.log() is a function that writes a message to log on the debugging console, such as Webkit or Firebug. In a browser you will not see anything on the screen. It logs a message to a debugging console. It is only available in Firefox with Firebug and in Webkit based browsers (Chrome and Safari).</p>
         <p>HTML:</p>
         <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
         <p>Head:</p>
         <p>In an HTML file, the html head is the first section in the code containing information about a web page's properties and links to external related files. For example, in the HTML head, you can have the title of the page, meta tags, CSS code, Open Graph tags, and JavaScript code.</p>
         <p>Body:</p>
         <p>Body tag defines the main content of an HTML document which displays on the browser. It can contain text content, paragraphs, headings, images, tables, links, videos, etc. The body must be the second element after the head tag or it should be placed between head and html tags.</p>
         <p>Variable (var):</p>
         <p>HTML var tag is a phrase tag which is used to define the variable for a mathematical equation, or in the programming context. The content within var tag renders in italic font in most of the browsers, but it can be overridden using appropriate CSS.</p>
